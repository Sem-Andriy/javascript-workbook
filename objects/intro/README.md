# Introduction to Objects

This folder marks the beginning of my journey into understanding **objects** in JavaScript.

Objects are one of the most important and flexible data structures in the language. They allow you to group related data using key-value pairs.

At this early stage, I'm focusing on how to:
- create simple objects
- understand the concept of keys and values
- access values using both **dot notation** and **bracket notation**

Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 35
};

console.log(person.firstName);     // using dot notation
console.log(person['lastName']);   // using bracket notation
```

## âœ… Practice tasks

I've completed a small set of exercises to reinforce the basics of working with objects. You can find them here:

ðŸ“„ [`js-object-tasks.js`](./js-object-tasks.js)

These tasks helped me understand how to create, read, and work with object properties more confidently.
