# DOM Task Manager

This folder contains a small project built as part of my JavaScript learning journey. I chose to create a **Task Manager** to apply DOM and event concepts in a meaningful and practical way.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice selecting and manipulating DOM elements
- Handle user interactions through events
- Dynamically update the interface based on user actions
- Apply foundational JavaScript logic in a practical scenario

---

## ⚙️ Project Scope

This is a simplified version of a Task Manager. It includes:

- Adding new tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Removing tasks

The UI is minimal by design, focusing on JavaScript functionality over visuals.

## 🧭 Learning context

This project helped me explore:
- The DOM and DOM manipulation
- Event handling (clicks, input, etc.)
- Basic UI logic in the browser

It’s a hands-on way to reinforce concepts while building something that resembles a real-world utility.
